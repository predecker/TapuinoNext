** 0.0.2-alpha+238 - 04 June 2022
  - Test 

** 0.0.2-alpha - 04 June 2022
  - Fixed various compatibility issues with framework-arduinoespressif32 > 2.0.1
    - the platform is pinned to version 4.0.1 (and hence framework 2.0.1) waiting for timer fixes to get into the next framework release and platform update (4.0.5 and 2.0.4?)
    - timer functionality was changed from a re-triggered one-shot to a repeat timer (retriggered one-shot does not work in the context of the move to IDF4.4 from framework 2.0.2)
    - input initialisation in the constructor of ESP32InputHandler.cpp also broke (shouldn't have done this in the first place)

  - Other minor improvments
    - changed the text for the firmware update menu to make it less confusing
    - added the spinner UI into the update progress display
    - changed the name of the firmware release to "update.bin" for ease of use
