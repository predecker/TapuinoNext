# TapuinoNext UI

## Insert Tap

Once you have selected this menu option you will be taken to the file browser. Navigate through the files to select a TAP file you wish to load and then use the **Button** action to select that file.

Directories can be selected in the same manner, use the previous directory ".." to go up one level.

TAP files with names longer than the LCD display width will scroll after a short pause. The scroll rate can be changed in the [Options Menu](/docs/ui/OptionsMenu.md).

Once you have selected a TAP file, the file will be verified and on success you will be taken to the [Play Menu](PlayMenu.md).
